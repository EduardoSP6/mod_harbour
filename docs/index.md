**Harbour for the web is finally here**. It took years to understand what we really need and how to implement it. But the Harbour for the web momentum, the xbase developers web momentum, has finally arrived.

mod Harbour is an **extension module** for Apache that provides full support to **execute PRGs and HRBs files from the web**.

If you are a Windows developer, you can build the web from your Windows 10 bash and then simply copy your PRGs to an Apache web server using the mod Harbour extension.

# Windows 10 bash support

The Windows 10 WSL (Windows SubSystem for Linux) lets you execute Ubuntu 18.04 from your Windows 10 bash, using Ubuntu (about 200 mb) and installing Apache on it. Detailed instructions are provided in the mod harbour repo wiki.

## OSX support

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
